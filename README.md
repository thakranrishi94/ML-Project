# Speaker Identification System

## Overview
The **Speaker Identification System** is a machine learning-based project that identifies speakers by analyzing their voice patterns. By training the system on a variety of voice samples, it can accurately recognize the speaker from an input audio file. This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in audio processing and speech recognition.

## Features
- **Voice-Based Identification**: Recognizes the speaker from an audio input.
- **Training with Multiple Voices**: Uses diverse voice samples to improve the model's accuracy.
- **Real-Time or Pre-Recorded Input**: Supports both live and pre-recorded audio files for speaker identification.
- **Scalable**: Can be trained to recognize additional speakers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for the implementation.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms for training and identifying speaker voices.
- **Audio Processing Libraries**: 
  - `Librosa` for feature extraction and audio manipulation.
  - `NumPy` and `Pandas` for data processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Collect audio samples from multiple speakers.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to represent voice characteristics.
3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, or Neural Networks) using the extracted features.
4. **Speaker Identification**: Predict the speaker's identity from the input voice sample.

## How to prepare database
create a main folder in the folder create all folders name with voice of the person and add the voices of that person and the connect the google drive to the code and then run that file
